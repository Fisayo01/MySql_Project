# SQL Project: Sales Data Analysis
This project involves working with four distinct datasets provided in CSV format. The goal is to create a new database, import these datasets, and perform various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights regarding sales, orders, and product performance. Below are the specific tasks and queries to be accomplished:

### Datasets
- Four CSV files containing sales data, product information, order details, and customer information.
### Objectives
1. Total Sales Revenue: Calculate the total sales revenue generated by the company.
2. Product Order Details: Extract the product name, order quantities, and order numbers for products sold through distributors and in-store only.
3. Sales by Representative: Retrieve all sales transactions handled by Nicholas Cunningham.
High Quantity Orders: Identify orders where the order quantity exceeds the average order quantity.
4. Top 10 Products: List the top 10 products based on order quantities, excluding the product category filter.
5 Alabama Orders: Count the number of orders from stores located in Alabama.
6. Order Details: Obtain all details for the order with order number “SO471”.
7. Regional Profit Analysis: Calculate the average profit generated from each sales region and sort the regions in descending order of average profit.
8. Above Average Sales Price: Using subqueries, extract data for sales where the sales price is higher than the average sales price.
9. Product Category Orders: Count the number of orders for each product category, focusing only on categories with 2000 or more orders.
10. Price Impact on Order Quantity: Determine the top five most expensive and top five cheapest products, and the total number of order quantities for each. This analysis aims to understand if the price of a product influences the number of quantities ordered by customers.
